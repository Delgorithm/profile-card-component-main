## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided "Profile card component"


### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://sensational-snickerdoodle-e1fb54.netlify.app/)

## My process

I've started by implementing the semantic of HTML:5 markup in order to make it "correct" for any users and people who'll review my code.
For the CSS, I took for example "Kevin Powell" techniques to elaborate my project.
As a beginner, having someone to help is necessary. I just hope to be able to code without looking a his cheatsheet too often.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this kind of project, the use of CSS Grid seems to be more useful than flexbox.
I find it very amusing to know what I'm doing and how it works. I'm still learning but It seems to finally get in my brain.


### Continued development

- CSS : Grid
- CSS : Media queries


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - This helped me to understand my first project and how to actually think as a frontend developper to achieve what I'm supposed to do. However, I still have to learn more things and practice to make it naturally.

- Visualdennis (https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/visualdenniss) : For the help he gave me through Frontend Mentor. The same way as I said just before. Thanks to him I also have another way to develop my code and to host it directly and faslty.
